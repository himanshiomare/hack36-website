Ranker, known as the world’s leading publisher for fan-powered rankings on just about everything with over one billion votes, has announced its rankings of the top video games right now featuring the very best on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.
Millions of gamers everywhere have ranked the most popular games in 2020. These lists of the most played video games right now features the very best first-person shooters, multiplayer battle royales, MOBAs, fighting games, RPGs, and collectible card video games from several different consoles.
“Some of Ranker’s strongest voting comes from gamers engaging with our extensive library of lists for any and every console, video game, and niche genre within,” said Mike Filliben, COO of Ranker. “It’s also why our Facebook gaming focused channels “Total Nerd”, “Button Mash,” “Anime Underground” and “Super News Supes” have a combined following of almost 9 million casual, hobbyist, and hardcore gamers.”
Ranker harnesses the wisdom of the crowd and the opinions of millions of super fans to be far more relevant and predictive than the opinion of one blogger or critic.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner. It is built around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous Prince from ancient and medieval Iran. The games have been developed and published by several different companies. The first two games in the series, Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame, were published by Broderbund. Prince of Persia 3D, the first to use 3D computer graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC, and developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive on the Sega Dreamcast. Ubisoft began developing and publishing the series in 2003 with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.

The series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been made into a film, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, penned in part by Mechner and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010. The franchise also includes Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel and the Lego line Lego Prince of Persia. The Assassin's Creed video game series is the spiritual successor to Prince of Persia.[

Assassin's Creed is an open-world action-adventure stealth video game franchise published by Ubisoft and developed mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil 
and its more advanced derivatives. Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Assassins,
 who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction and fictional characters intertwined with 
 real-world historical events and figures. For the majority of time players control an Assassin in the past history, while also playing as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, 
 who hunt down their Templar targets. The series took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, based on the historical Hashashin sect of the medieval Middle East,
  while building upon concepts from the Prince of Persia series
