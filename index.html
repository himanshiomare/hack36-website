            <h1>How to stay positive during COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging us in ways we could never have imagined, from unprecedented amounts of family time to homeschooling to working remotely—or not working at all. These sudden, rapid changes in the way we live, coupled with uncertainty, can feel overwhelming. While we may know that it’s helpful for everyone to stay positive, it’s sometimes easier said than done.
                
                Remember it will not be this way forever. This is a difficult time, but it is just that — a time. 
                Recognize what you are doing well and give yourself credit. It may be tough right now, but you have managed some things really well. Think about the physical, logistical, mental, and emotional struggles you may have encountered in the last few months, and the good—even great—way you approached and handled those challenges.
                Now as Covid’s second wave surges in INDIA, history repeats itself. First as tragedy, then as farce. One year after the imposition of the world’s strictest lockdown, our country is now in the grip of a second Covid-19 wave. Aided by new variants, Covid-19 is spreading rapidly as in the penchants of governments for arbitrary mini lockdowns, weekend lockdowns, full lockdowns and night curfews.
                
                But we can overcome to this situation by trust, confidence, transparency and coordination. These ought to be the tools for India as we respond to the second wave. There is still time to course correct.
