                COUNSELING IN A PANDEMIC
                During COVID-19, everyone needs a counselor or therapist. In fact, the wide variety of counselors available are needed more than ever. In this post, we will look at several types of counselor and explain why they are important during the pandemic.

                School counselors are needed more than ever. Whether you’re a college student trying to adjust to a new life on the campus or an online learner, these stressful times can make getting an education more challenging. Alternatively, the pandemic may make you wonder which careers are sustainable. That’s why it’s important to seek help from a school counselor.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Marriage is not the only relationship that needs counseling. It’s also important for families to seek counseling at this time. The changing world means that how people are raising their families are different, and how families interact while they are under the same roof are different as well. Talking to a counselor about family issues is not a sign you’ve failed as a parent or family member; many people need assistance during this time, including families. Don’t be afraid to talk to a counselor or therapist about any of your needs.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
         Some people who were making decent money may see themselves living off unemployment or having their salaries cut. It can be more difficult to make wise financial decisions when you have less money. Not to mention, financial issues can lead to several marital problems. Because of this, it’s important for someone who is suffering financially to seek help from a professional.

        Counseling for Addictions
        During the pandemic, alcohol usage has skyrocketed. Those who had only a drink every now and then may have found themselves drinking even more, leading to several issues in the process. Addiction, especially when financial times are tough and everyone is under the same roof, can spell disaster. A counselor can help identify triggers and look for ways to help you manage any addictions you have. Make sure you drink in moderation in a pandemic.

A Friend to Talk to
Another reason why someone may go to a counselor in these times is simply because they need someone to talk to. COVID-19 can be a time of loneliness, especially those who haven’t seen their friends for months. While a therapist is not someone you are going to have a beer with, they can be there for you when you want to vent and express your emotions, which is something a friend should do.

        Counseling Online
        Many people are wondering where they can speak to a therapist. While in-person therapy is available, many do not want to take the risk due to the pandemic. This has caused a rise in online counseling and therapy.
        Websites such as ReGain can make it easier to connect to a counselor, be it through email, video chat, or another method. Talking to a counselor online can be quite effective, and it’s important to seek help from one if you feel as though you need it. Everyone needs a little help during this time, and there is no shame doing so.
